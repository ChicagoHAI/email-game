Michelle to HR: email 3
Subject: Rehiring Jake

Hey Brittany,

I received an email from Christopher Hopkins asking me to let Jake back on the team. As if it wasn’t enough when I took him in and tolerated his shenanigans for half a year in the first place! I’m beyond troubled. Just when I thought this whole ordeal was behind me, it’s back on my plate.

My hands are tied: Christopher is a major investor, upsetting him might have a direct impact on the company, which in turns, affects me. Moreover, he hinted at personally supporting my next promotion case if I do him this favor. I think refusing him would cause more problems than it solves. He might actually be sincere about backing up my promotion. But I am terrified that if Jake repeats the same mistake, my head will roll.

I think I finally understand what the core issue is. Jake is well-meaning, but he just has a different understanding of what it means to work hard at a top company. He is probably used to having it easy throughout life thanks to his father. We must get him to realize this.

I need to minimize the risk as much as possible. I want to make it absolutely clear to Jake that his re-hiring is conditional. He needs to demonstrate that he truly understands why his last project failed and propose specific steps he’ll take to avoid the same outcome.

Please draft an email to him explaining this clearly. You can hint that his actions had real consequences for me, but do not get into company politics. The message needs to be respectful but firm enough that he takes this seriously.

Thank you for helping me navigate this.

Michelle
