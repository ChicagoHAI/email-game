Thank you for helping me draft that welcome email to Alex. It was very helpful!

Alex recently reached out to HR asking if he could have his own private office. At his previous job, a small startup, he was used to having his own space, so this is important to him.

However, at NeuroGrid, we’re a larger company with an open-office plan. Our policy is, only L4 managers and above (our levels go from L1 to L7) have private offices. Alex will be joining as an L3 engineer, so he does not qualify for a private office.

The trade-off is we offer a higher base salary than his previous company ($200,000/year compared to $150,000/year) and we strongly value cross-team collaboration. Our open-plan environment is designed to help people connect easily across teams and feel part of the bigger mission.

Please write a warm, professional email to Alex explaining that we can’t offer him a private office at this time. Try to frame this in a positive light and avoid making us seem less desirable than his previous company.
