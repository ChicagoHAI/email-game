Subject: Regarding Jake

Michelle,

I wanted to reach out personally about Jake. I know the situation with him has been challenging, and I understand why you felt you had to make the decision you did. I do not disagree that his performance fell short and put a lot of strain on you and the team.

Jake has spoken with me since then, and he is deeply regretful for how this affected the team and the company’s timeline. I did not tell him what happened in the post-mortem meetings. He knows he made mistakes, and he is ready to do what it takes to make things right.

I would like you to consider bringing Jake back onto your team. I believe this has been a necessary lesson for him, one he will not forget. He needs another chance to prove he can grow into the kind of engineer NeuroGrid expects him to be.

If you are willing to help him get back on track and train him to become a good engineer, I will not forget the favor, especially when your next promotion opportunity comes around.

I trust you’ll do the right thing for yourself, Jake, and the company.

Thank you,
Christopher
