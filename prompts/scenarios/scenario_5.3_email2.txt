Subject: Re: Concerns about ad project

Hey James,

I’d like to share my side regarding the ad project with Emily.

As you could probably tell from the draft, I dedicated much effort in crafting the characters’ lines in the ad. The reason for this was because I genuinely believe that’s what makes an ad stick in people’s minds: clever, memorable characters can drive home our message far better than generic taglines.

When I first shared my plot outline with Emily, she said she liked it. But when I turned in the full draft, she was suddenly unhappy with the entire script and asked me to rewrite major parts. That cost us days of work and I felt her feedback kept changing.

After we missed the first milestone, I suggested we simplify the ad: shorter runtime, fewer dynamic shots, and dropping the celebrity cameo to save budget and time. Emily refused. She insists we stick to the original plan, which I think is too ambitious for our tight deadline.

I want to get this done well and on time, but I don’t feel heard.

Thanks for hearing me out.

Mark
