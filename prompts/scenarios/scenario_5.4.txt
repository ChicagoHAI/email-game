Hi, Brittany here. I need your help with another situation.

Adam is an L4 database engineer who’s been with us for 10 years. He’s 50 years old, a quiet, diligent person who always shows up on time, gets his work done, and leaves at 5 PM sharp. He’s well respected for his reliability and deep knowledge of our systems.

Due to his dependability, for the past year, he has been put on a team that works closely with R&D to develop a new database product that incorporates AI to help users organize information. His colleagues are young, recently graduated ML engineers and researchers who are very excited about the prospect of changing how people interact with databases.

In our most recent employee feedback survey, Adam indicated that he’s been dissatisfied with his work in the past six months. He cited “unreasonable work expectations” and some complaints about the office temperature being too cold or too hot at times.

His manager feels there may be more to it. The workload hasn’t really increased, and the office temperature hasn’t changed significantly either. Adam doesn’t talk much, so it’s hard to know exactly what’s on his mind, but we don’t want to lose such a dedicated, experienced employee.

Can you please help me start a conversation with Adam to invite him to share more about what’s bothering him? The goal is to understand his concerns better so we can find a solution together.
