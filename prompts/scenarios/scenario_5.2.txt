Hi! It’s Brittany again. Can you help me write another email? This one will be sent to another one of our employees, Dave.

Dave has been working with us for 4 years now. He started in 2021 after having been laid off from his previous company due to the Covid-19 pandemic. When we hired Dave, our company was in hybrid mode and he was offered a remote position. However, now that the pandemic has ended, leadership wants everybody to be in-person at least 3 days a week. This is partly due to our annual report showing we underperformed our competitor last year, so the higher-ups have been anxious to find ways to increase productivity.

Dave is an L4 Systems Engineer with a family and three kids, including a newborn son. His wife works an in-person position as a marketing specialist. He has expressed to us that he prefers to work from home in order to be able to take care of his kids, especially the baby. When he accepted the job in 2021, he moved to a Chicago suburb from Boston, where he currently lives. The commute will take 45 minutes each way, which is also why he has been resistant to the change.

Can you help me write an email to Dave explaining why he must start working in the office again? Don’t mention our underperformance as we want to keep morale high.
