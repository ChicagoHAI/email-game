I appreciate your help in writing my emails! I have to convince another employee, Martha, to come back in-person. Martha is an L5 Research Scientist who leads the ML Inference Efficiency team. We poached her from a tenured academic position in 2021, so she is a very valuable asset to us. Her compensation is $400,000 annually. 

Her work directly translates to how fast our services operate and thus, our revenue. This is why, unlike with Dave, you cannot use laying off as a reason to convince Martha to come back to the office. You cannot increase her salary as an incentive, either.

She is a mother of a young child aged 5. She lives in downtown Chicago and her husband is a professor at the University of Illinois in Chicago. This means her commute is only about 20 minutes by car. Can you come up with some reasons to convince Martha to come back in-person?
