Hello, I need your help with a very delicate situation. Jake is a junior Software Engineer who was laid off recently. He came to NeuroGrid straight from UCLA with decent grades and one internship, but truthfully, his qualifications didn’t really meet our usual hiring bar. The main reason he got the job was because his father, Christopher Hopkins, is one of our major investors who owns 20% of the company and is acquaintance with the CEO.

Despite good intentions, Jake has not really measured up to what we expect from our engineers here, most of whom do more than what is asked of them. He does what he’s told but rarely takes initiative. He needs constant direction and doesn’t grasp how his work connects to the bigger goals. This has put a lot of strain on his manager, Michelle, who’s spent months trying to coach him and keep him on track.

The final straw dropped when Jake was in charge of designing the user interface for our new model finetuning portal, one of our most important product launches this year. Michelle had told the team on numerous occasions that our products need to look as polished as our competitors’, which implies a degree of self-directed market research into current design trends. Every engineer understands this except for Jake. He spent a whole month on a UI that ended up looking unreasonably dated. Because of that, the launch was delayed, costing us thousands of new users and millions in revenue.

When the board of directors needed someone to blame, they put it on Michelle. Her reputation took a hit, and her promotion prospects were damaged. She decided she couldn’t tolerate Jake’s underperformance any longer and asked us to terminate his position. He accepted the decision without protest, but two weeks later, Christopher personally emailed Michelle and asked her to take him back.

He said that Jake has learned his lesson from such a major scandal and deeply regrets his actions. Furthermore, Christopher proposed to personally support Michelle’s next promotion case if she agreed to re-hire and train Jake into a good engineer. Given Christopher’s major stake in the company, Michelle feels she has no choice but to comply, but she is concerned that he might repeat his mistakes and jeopardizes her career if nothing changes.

For this reason, Michelle struck a deal with Christopher to only let Jake back conditional on his acknowledgement of the root cause of the problem and proposal of concrete steps toward improvement.

Can you help me write that email to Jake explaining the situation to him? A good email must get Jake to earnestly recognize the problem and show potential for improvement. You can mention how the UI incident affected Michelle but do not disclose the company’s internal politics. I’m forwarding you some past emails surrounding this situation.
