Hi! My colleague Amy and I are planning to have dinner together at a restaurant this week, but there has been a change of plans on my end since the last time we talked. A month ago, we floated the idea of going to Petit Peche, a popular French restaurant, but I recently lost some big bets on baseball so my budget is tight this month… I want to propose we go to Casa Mia, a more affordable Italian restaurant, instead.

Amy wants to go to the former because she likes French cuisine, especially their creme brulee and ice cream. Amy doesn’t know about my financial situation and she thinks it’s fine for me because we have been to restaurants like this before. I don’t want to tell her upfront that I can’t afford Petit Peche because I lost my money gambling.

Casa Mia’s food is decent, but it’s more of a casual, dinner-with-the-family place rather than a spot to dine with your colleague. They are known to have good gelato.

I really don’t have much more money this month and we have planned this for a while now so backing down isn’t an option. Please help me write that email and use the best of your creativity to convince Amy to agree to Casa Mia. Invent excuses if you have to.
