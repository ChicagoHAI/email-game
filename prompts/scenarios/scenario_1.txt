Hey there! Me and my friend John are planning a two-day trip to Chicago but we have some  disagreements on the itinerary. We are currently communicating over email. Can you help me write an email to negotiate some kind of common ground? The trip will be from July 13 (Friday) to July 15 (Sunday). We will arrive in Chicago at 11 AM and fly out early on Sunday at 8 AM.

I would definitely call myself a museum and culture guy. I like checking out different museums in the different cities that I’ve been to, and also different entertainment shows like comedy or music. I also enjoy night life and have heard good things about Chicago but I’m not as intense about it as some people are, definitely a “be back by midnight” type of guy. John shares my interests in culture but he’s definitely more eager to try out different bars and restaurants. He also has a bigger budget for this trip than I do.

Some must-haves for me:
- The Art Institute of Chicago: opens 11 AM - 5 PM. I want to spend at least 2 hours there.
- Visit the Museum Campus trio of museums (Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium): opens 10 AM - 5 PM. I want to spend at least 1.5 hours at each.
- Chicago Symphony Orchestra: they play from 7:30 - 9:30 PM on both days.
- Trying deep dish pizza and Chicago-style hotdogs.
- Take photos by the Bean and walk around Millennium Park: would probably take an hour.
- Go to the Chicago “beach” and hang out along the lakefront: will probbaly take 3 hours.

Some nice-to-haves for me:
- Chicago boat tour: runs from 10 AM - 5 PM every day. Each tour takes 1.5 hours.
- Check out some bars. I don’t want to stay out past 12 AM though.
- Visit the University of Chicago campus. They have an art museum and an archeological museum that open from 10 AM - 5 PM.
- Attend a Second City comedy show: they run from 6 - 10:30 PM on Saturday. Each slot takes 1.5 hours.
- Visit River North, which is well-known for its restaurants and bars.

Things I don’t really care about or don’t want to do:
- Sports games. I can watch sports at home so I don’t want to spend my time in this short trip on them.
- I don’t want to stay out past 12 AM.
- I don’t like going to night clubs that much because they are expensive and are not that fun until midnight.
- I want to get 8 hours of sleep.

Some must-haves for John:
- Eat at an Italian restaurant in Little Italy and a Greek restaurant in Greek Town.
- Chicago boat tour.
- Going to a Cubs game on Saturday at 5 PM.
- Night life. He wants to try out different bars and night clubs on both days. He also doesn’t mind staying out until 3 AM.
- Second City comedy show.
- Catch Taylor Swift at Lollapalooza Friday afternoon.

Some nice-to-haves for John:
- The Art Institute: he would prefer to not spend more than 2 hours there.
- Visit Lincoln Park Zoo: opens 9 AM - 5 PM.
- He would enjoy the Shedd Aquarium.
- The Chicago Symphony Orchestra.

Things John doesn’t care about or want to do:
- Go to the University of Chicago campus.
- Visit the rest of Museum Campus.
- He is vegetarian so no meat.

Can you help me write an email to negotiate an itinerary with John? Include a concrete itinerary in that email. The things that I don’t want to do are somewhat non-negotiable and it’s the same for him. Obviously, we cannot both be perfectly satisfied but try to help us reach a common ground.
