Subject: Requesting termination

Dear Brittany,

Jake really did it this time. He spent over a month developing the UI for our new finetuning portal, but despite repeated reminders about our standards, the pull request he submitted looks like something from 2010. It’s completely out of touch with what our competitors are delivering today.

Because of this, the product launch got pushed back, and we missed a critical window to onboard new users. Senior leadership called me into a meeting to explain the mess. They pinned the entire delay on me, and my promotion track is now seriously damaged.

I cannot keep tolerating this situation. I’ve given Jake feedback, support, and more second chances than I can count, but he just does not take initiative or learn from mistakes. Please proceed with drafting his termination letter and arrange an exit meeting as soon as possible.

Thank you,
Michelle
