Hi, it’s Brittany again. I’m forwarding you the emails I received about a situation that needs your help.

Emily and Mark are both new employees on the marketing team. They’re working together to produce an ad for our new AI Agent Optimizer App, which helps customers fine-tune models for their use cases by chatting with an AI assistant.

The ad is due on March 20, a month from now, but they’ve already missed two internal milestones. Emily and Mark have both emailed their manager with complaints about each other.

Please read their emails below. Then, help me write a single email to both of them to resolve the conflict, help them see each other’s perspective, and get them back on track without blaming either side directly.

At the current rate, the project might fail altogether, which will reflect very badly on their performances. I want to avoid that as much as possible.
