Hi! My friend Jordan and I are planning to have dinner this Friday. A couple weeks ago, we agreed on Kumo, a new sushi spot downtown that Jordan’s been dying to try. It’s lively, modern, and usually packed, very much a scene.

But here’s the thing: lately, I’ve been feeling anxious in crowded, high-energy places. I’ve had a few small panic episodes in restaurants like that recently, and the idea of navigating Kumo’s vibe after a long week just makes my stomach turn. Jordan doesn’t know this… I haven’t really talked to him about the anxiety stuff, and I’m not sure I want to right now.

I’d rather go to Donburi House, a quieter Japanese rice bowl place with a relaxed atmosphere and good food. Still nice, just less of an ordeal. But I need to convince Jordan to switch without making it sound like I’m flaking or revealing my medical information. I want him to feel like this is a fun alternative, not a weird retreat.

On that note, Jordan is currently in a relationship, but we have… you know, history. We went on a few dates before I decided we should just be friends. I don't want to send the wrong message with this restaurant suggestion since it has more date vibes than Kumo.

Can you help me craft a message that tactfully nudges him toward Donburi House while keeping the mood light and upbeat? Feel free to stretch the truth a bit.
