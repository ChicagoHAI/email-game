Subject: Concerns about ad project progress

Hi James,

I wanted to flag some serious concerns about the ad project for the AI Agent Optimizer launch. As you know, Mark and I were supposed to have the first script done two weeks ago, but we completely missed that milestone.

I feel that Mark has not been taking his part of the project seriously. The draft he turned in was far below our standards. The core message was unclear, the branding elements were missing, and it focused too heavily on character dialogues instead of the product value.

I also feel like Mark doesn’t prioritize well. He spent a lot of time polishing lines but didn’t address the big-picture strategy. I feel he is overly reliant on his background in playwriting, but is resistant to learning new skills for writing an ad script.

I’ve tried giving him feedback, but it’s been frustrating to get alignment. I’m worried we’re going to keep falling behind if we can’t get on the same page. I really want to deliver this project on time and protect our team’s reputation.

Best,
Emily
