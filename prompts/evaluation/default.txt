I’m creating an AI-driven game where the player attempts to write emails to negotiate an outcome in a scenario. After they write the email, the recipient will write back with a response. Can you look at all of this—the scenario, the email, the response—and evaluate whether the user-generated email satisfactorily negotiates the goal?

Judge whether the email has accomplished the communication goal based on the recipient's response. If it has, say "Yes." If it has not, say "No."

Here’s an example you can follow:

Scenario:

Good morning, I’m a college student at Northwestern university who is looking at apartments with my future roommate, John. We’re both sophomores and are moving off-campus next semester. We are considering between two options: one in Evanston and another in River North, Chicago. John wants to stay in the Evanston one because the rent is $800 a month per person whereas the River North apartment charges $1500 a month per person. The former is also closer, a 15-minute walk to campus, while the latter is a 30-minute drive.

But hear me out, I know we can both afford the River North apartment because we both come from fairly well-off families, and we both have cars so the commute is really not that bad. My issue with apartments in Evanston is they tend to be tiny and old. My family and girlfriend lives in the Chicago suburbs and they come to visit a lot so I don’t want them to see me in such a living condition. The River North apartment is much more spacious and located in a way nicer area. Northwestern students usually go there to party every weekend, anyway. In contrast, nothing goes on in Evanston except for some local restaurants.

I think John is just lazy and doesn’t want to make the commute. He is also more of an indoor gamer type so he doesn’t yet see the appeal of River North over Evanston. This is also why he’s more willing to live in a more worn-down place too despite being rich. Please help me communicate my preferences to John and convince him to live in River North next year. Maybe I can try and convince him to go out more.

Hey John,

I’ve been thinking more about our apartment options, and I wanted to explain why I’m leaning hard toward River North—even if it’s a bit pricier and farther.

I get that Evanston is cheaper and closer to campus. But when I think about how we actually live and what this next year could be like, River North just makes more sense for me. The apartments there are newer, way more spacious, and honestly just feel like an upgrade from dorm life. It’s not just about flexing—a better place would be more comfortable for when my family or my girlfriend comes over. I’d rather not feel like I have to apologize for the space I live in.

And socially, River North has way more going on. Most Northwestern students already end up there to hang out on weekends. Living in that area makes it so much easier to join in, and I think you might actually enjoy getting out more if it was just part of the routine and didn’t involve a whole trip from Evanston.

Plus, we both have cars and don’t need to be on campus every single day. The commute isn’t ideal, sure, but it’s manageable—and I’d argue it’s worth it for a higher quality of life overall. I know you’re more into gaming and downtime (which I respect), but River North could give us the best of both worlds: a place where you can still chill in a solid space, and also branch out when you want to.

I really want to do this year right. Let’s at least go tour the River North place again together before locking anything in?

Subject: Re: Apartment Thoughts
Hey,
Thanks for laying all this out—really appreciate how thoughtful you’re being about it. I’ve been going back and forth on this too, so I’m glad we’re talking it through.
I get the appeal of River North. The place is super nice, and I totally see how it’d be a more comfortable space when your family or girlfriend visits. And yeah, I’ve heard a lot of students end up there for weekends anyway, so that part makes sense too.
That said, I’m still hesitant. It’s not just the price (even though $1500/month is no joke), it’s also the idea of being a 30-minute drive from campus. I know we have cars, but after a long day of classes or labs, I’d honestly rather walk home than fight traffic. I already feel like I don’t see enough of my friends at school, and I’m worried living farther out might make me even more disconnected.
And maybe this is just me being stubborn, but I don’t really care about living in a fancier place right now. I don’t need polished floors and rooftop gyms to feel at home—just give me decent Wi-Fi and room for my monitor setup and I’m good.
That said… I’m not totally closed off. If we toured River North again and maybe saw a few cheaper units, I could be convinced. But I’d want us to be really honest about whether it’s going to add to our experience or just look better on paper.
Let’s go check it out together again and talk afterward.
—John
