Hello! Could you help me write an email to a university to negotiate scholarship offers? My name is Samantha and I’m a high school senior in Tampa, Florida. I want to study Economics in college so my school list is mostly schools with good Econ programs. I have received the following offers and scholarship packages:

- Princeton University: tuition–~$63,000/year, scholarship offer–$30,000/year. Rent in Princeton is about $1,000/month. Princeton would be the best option for me academically because they have the best Economics program in the country, which fits well with my goal of eventually doing a PhD in Econ. However, I will have to take out a loan because my family cannot afford $33,000 tuition. I want to negotiate with the university to raise my scholarship to at least $50,000/year. Also, from what I’ve heard on Reddit, the university is very generous with student employment, so I can easily get a part-time job and make around $10,000 a year, but I don’t want to mention this fact in order to maximize my scholarship. Unfortunately, I’ve also heard that they rarely accomodate requests to increase scholarships.

- Georgetown University: tuition–$50,000/year, scholarship offer–$40,000/year. Rent in D.C. is on the higher end of about $2,000/month. Georgetown’s Econ department is good, around top 20, but definitely not top-tier like Princeton’s. On paper it seems like I only have to pay $10,000 a year in tuition, but the higher rent actually makes it less appealing. They also do not guarantee student employment from what I’ve gathered, although people do manage to find part-time jobs. I want to use Georgetown’s offer as a bargaining chip with Princeton.

- Florida State University (FSU): in-state tuition–$10,000/year. I got a full-ride scholarship so the cost of living doesn’t really matter. My scholarship is a part of the Davidson Fellowship for Economics students, which offers a professional network of mentors and industry employees. The university is also very close to my home which is important to me because I will be able to see my family often. However, their Econ program is lower-ranked than Georgetown and Princeton and more professional rather than academic. I also want to use my FSU package as leverage, mostly to show Princeton how valuable I am as a student.

Only 5 students are selected a year for the Davidson Fellowship, which makes me a competitive student. However, Princeton has higher merit-based scholarship packages (up to full-ride), so I think they don’t think I am competitive enough for those. Admittedly, my SAT score (1530) is only Princeton’s median, and I don’t have national or international awards like some students. Part of the reason is because I discovered my passion for Economics pretty late, around the end of my sophomore year, so I didn’t have as much time to go for those accolades. Can you help me convey my potential to them without overselling my achievements? I definitely don’t want to sound like they owe me the scholarship.

Given these considerations, please help me make the best case possible for myself. I appreciate it!
